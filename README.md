This is supposed to be a port of [sbm-12's](https://github.com/sbm12/bsky-Pack2List) to Node.js. I'm also adding OAuth support.

I'm [@dabockster.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/dabockster.bsky.social) over there if you have any questions/problems.

Make sure to read the LICENSE.md file! It isn't your run of the mill license!
